**Tips while visiting Sinhagad.**

.  In weekends sinhagad is too crowded, and finding a peaceful corner is not impossible. So I prefer to go there at working days.

. Take a heavy lunch/ breakfast as there will be a lot of walking.

. Take your water. A bottle of water within the fort costs almost double the market price.

. Early morning is the best time. Try to enter as soon as the fort is opened to avoid noisy crowds.

**If you have any suggestions, or doubts comment below.**
