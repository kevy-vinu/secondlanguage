Hey! I'm keerthana. Thank you for stopping by. This is my personal blog where I post my random interests and thoughts. I have done chemistry in my graduation but somehow I did realize the fact that it was not for me. So I never tried efficiently to get a job in that field. When I was struggling to decide on my career path, I found my true passion in preparing foods - yeah! cooking, exactly :). I often add photographs here, the way I see the world and my recipes for cooking. My partner [Kevy](https://gnulinuxmate.com) is the backbone of this blog. He handles all the tech stuffs on which I usually scratch my head. So welcome again to my online space. This will be a good read in your leisure time.

And why the name naran.ga?
Lol! I do not know. It just came as I love the color yellow. I listen to my gut.

Peace, Love, Meditate!
